This vignette explains how to run a `GeoSOM` model in `geosom` package.

### Load data and package

Here use `pmc` data,more details see `help(pmc)`.

```{r Load-data-and-package}
library(geosom)

data(pmc)
head(pmc)
```

### Determining the optimal paramater for GeoSOM

``` r
set.seed(20220724)
tictoc::tic()
geosom_bestparam(data = pmc, 
                 coords = c("centroidx","centroidy"),
                 wt = c(seq(0.1,1,by = 0.1),2:5),
                 xdim = 4:10, ydim = 4:10,cores = 6) -> g_bestparam
tictoc::toc()
## 59.37 sec elapsed
```

``` r
g_bestparam
## $wt
## [1] 0.9
## 
## $xdim
## [1] 4
## 
## $ydim
## [1] 4
##

```


### Build GeoSOM model

```{r Build-and-assess-geosom-model}
g = geosom(data = pmc, coords = c("centroidx","centroidy"), wt = .9,
           grid = geosomgrid(4,4,topo = "rectangular",
                             neighbourhood.fct = "gaussian"))
```

### Assessing the quality of the map

The ```geosom_quality()``` computes several measures to help assess the quality of a GeoSOM.

```{r}
geosom_quality(g)
```


* **Quantization error**: Average squared distance between the data points and the map's prototypes to which they are mapped. Lower is better.

* **Percentage of explained variance**: Similar to other clustering methods, the share of total variance that is explained by the clustering (equal to 1 minus the ratio of quantization error to total variance). Higher is better.

* **Topographic error**: Measures how well the topographic structure of the data is preserved on the map. It is computed as the share of observations for which the best-matching node is not a neighbor of the second-best matching node on the map. Lower is better: 0 indicates excellent topographic representation (all best and second-best matching nodes are neighbors), 1 is the maximum error (best and second-best nodes are never neighbors).

* **Kaski-Lagus error**: Combines aspects of the quantization and topographic error. It is the sum of the mean distance between points and their best-matching prototypes, and of the mean geodesic distance (pairwise prototype distances following the SOM grid) between the points and their second-best matching prototype.

### Superclasses of GeoSOM

It is common to further cluster the GeoSOM map into superclasses, groups of cells with similar profiles. This is done using classic clustering algorithms on the map's prototypes.

Two methods are implemented in `spEcula` now, PAM (k-medians) and hierarchical clustering. This is how to obtain them in R. In this example, we choose 12 superclasses. We will return to the choice of superclasses below.

```{r}
g_superclass = geosom_superclass(g,12,method = 'pam')
g_superclass
```

### Plotting general map information

```geosom_plot()``` creates a variety of different interactive SOM visualizations. 
Using the ```type``` argument to the function, one the following types of plots can be created:

* **Observations Cloud**: visualize the observations as points inside their cell.

```{r}
geosom_plot(g, type = "Cloud", superclass = g_superclass)
```

* **Hitmap** or **population map**: visualizes the number of observation per cell. The areas of the inner shapes are proportional to their population.  
The background colors indicate the superclasses. The palette of these colors can be adapted using the ```palsc``` argument.

```{r}
geosom_plot(g, type = "Hitmap", superclass = g_superclass)
```


* **UMatrix** is a way to explore the topography of the map. It shows the average distance between each cell and its neighbors' prototypes, on a color scale. On this map, the darker cells are close to their neighbors, while the brighter cells are more distant from their neighbors.

```{r}
geosom_plot(g, type = "UMatrix", superclass = g_superclass)
```


### Plotting numeric variables on the map

```geosom_plot()``` offers several types of plots for numeric variables : 

* circular barplot
* barplot
* boxplot
* radar plot
* lines plot
* color plot (heat map)

In all of these plots, by default the means of the chosen variables are displayed within each cell. Other choices of values (medians or prototypes) can be specified using the ```values``` parameter. The scales of the plots can also be adapted, using the ```scales``` argument. Colors of the variables are controlled by the ```palvar``` argument.

```{r }
geosom_plot(g, type = "Circular", superclass = g_superclass)
```

On the following barplot, we plot the protoype values instead of the observations means.

```{r}
geosom_plot(g, type = "Barplot", superclass = g_superclass, values = "prototypes") 
```

On the following box-and-whisker plot, the scales are set to be the same accross variables.

```{r}
geosom_plot(g, type = "Boxplot", superclass = g_superclass, scales = "same") 
```

On the following lines plot, we use the observation medians instead of the means.

```{r}
geosom_plot(g, type = "Line", superclass = g_superclass, values = "median") 
```

The following radar chart uses the default parameters.

```{r}
geosom_plot(g, type = "Radar", superclass = g_superclass) 
```

The color plot, or heat map, applies to a single numeric variable. The superclass overlay can be removed by setting the ```showSC``` parameter to ```FALSE```.

```{r}
geosom_plot(g, type = "Color", superclass = g_superclass) 
```

You can save those plot use `htmlwidgets::saveWidget()`,like:

```r
htmlwidgets::saveWidget(geosom_plot(g,type = "Circular",
                                    superclass = g_superclass),
                        './Circular.html')
```

### Choosing the number of superclasses

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=5} 
geosom_bestsuperclass(g)
```

### Get and viz the geosom cluster label

```{r}
g_label = geosom_clusterlabel(g,g_superclass)
g_label
```

```{r fig.width=7.5, fig.height=5}
library(sf)
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

pmc %>% 
  mutate(zone = as.factor(g_label)) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("centroidx","centroidy")) %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_sf(aes(col = zone),size = 1.25,shape = 17) +
  scale_color_discrete(type = 'viridis') +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(axis.text = element_blank(),
        axis.ticks = element_blank())
```

You can also use `mapview` to interactive view.

```{r}
pmc %>% 
  mutate(zone = as.factor(g_label)) %>% 
  st_as_sf(coords = c("centroidx","centroidy")) %>% 
  mapview::mapview(zcol = "zone",cex = 5, legend = TRUE)
```
